		<h2>Rick</h2>
		<div>
		<p><strong class="destaque">Rick Sanchez</strong> is the co-eponymous main character and leading protagonist of the show. He is a <b class="destaque">genius scientist</b> whose<br /> alcoholism and reckless, nihilistic behavior are a source of concern for his daughter's family, as well as the safety of their<br /> son, Morty. He is voiced by <em>Justin Roiland</em>. He is later revealed to be Morty's cousin in an interview with Roiland himself.</p>

		<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>Not much is known about Rick's life before his current state seen in the show except for a few things that have been vaguely<br /> mentioned in the series. It has been mentioned multiple times that Rick has been absent from the family for at least fourteen<br /> years and it wasn't until one year before the events of "Something Ricked This Way Comes" when Rick finally returned to the<br /> Smith house on January 15th.[4] The reason for his absence is unknown to the rest of the family.</p>

		<p>In the Pilot episode, Rick told Beth that he loved the eggs that she made him and that her mother would have loved them too<br /> if she were still there. In the episode Rick Potion #9, it is revealed that Rick has a very pessimistic worldview, informing Morty<br /> that love is "just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed", advising him not to continue the cycle of love, marriage<br /> and heartbreak that he had to go through and that his parents would likely go through, encouraging him to direct his energy<br /> towards science. This could imply that the woman he married before is either divorced and/or deceased as of now. In<br /> the same episode, he and Morty leave their original dimension (Dimension C-137) in favour of the one they currently reside in.</p>

		<p>In the episode Get Schwifty, it was revealed that when Rick was somewhere in his college years or in his 20's, he, Birdperson,<br /> and Squanchy were in a rock band called "The Flesh Curtains".</p>

		<p>Rick is 60 years old and currently resides in his room in the Smith house. In the garage, he works on his inventions and<br /> scientific formulas and tests them out, traveling to other dimensions, building various robots and devices, and causing general<br /> mayhem in different parts of the universe.</p>

		<p>In the episode "The Wedding Squanchers", Rick willingly turned himself over to the Galactic Federation and was sent to one of<br /> their maximum security prisons. He would later orchestrate a massive escape attempt, leading to the elimination of the<br /> Council of Ricks, significant damage to the Citadel and the destabilization of the entire Galactic Federation's economy.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Morty</h2>
		<img src="morty.jpg" / style="float: right;" title="Morty" alt="morty.jpg" >
		<p><strong class="destaque">Mortimer "Morty" Smith Sr.</strong> is one of the two eponymous main protagonists in Rick and Morty. He is the grandson of<br /> Rick and is often forced to tag along on his various misadventures. Morty attends Harry Herpson High School along<br /> with his sister, Summer.</p>

		<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>Although the information is easily accessible, not much has been revealed about Morty's past life. Currently, Morty is 14<br /> years old, and as of the beginning of the series, Rick Sanchez had been mysteriously missing from the family for a total<br /> of 14 years. It is unknown if Morty's birth and Rick's disappearance are linked to each other, but it has been shown on two<br /> separate occasions that Rick knew Morty when he was only a baby. In the episode "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind",<br /> one of Rick's happy memories of Morty was picking him up as a baby. In the episode "Get Schwifty", a picture on<br /> Birdperson's wall depicted Rick holding a baby, who, although had an ambiguous identity, was very likely Morty at that same age.</p>

		<p>In the episode "Raising Gazorpazorp", Beth accidentally admitted that when Morty was a baby, Jerry filled Morty with his<br /> own insecurity, turning him into the worrying coward he is today.</p>
